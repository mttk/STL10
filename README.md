#STL-10 Utils
## http://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/

After battling for some time with reading the STL-10 dataset from the raw binary files in python 2.7, I've managed to load them quite easily and I'm sharing the solution here in hopes of saving time for other people.

The usage is relatively straightforward, the file `stl10_input.py` contains all the necessary methods for downloading and reading data along with a test main funct for displaying an image.
